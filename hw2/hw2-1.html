        1. What will  be the order of execution between setImmediate(callback) and setTimeout(callback, 0)

            setImmediate(callback) would be executed first because setTimeout(callback, 0) run after a minimum threshold
            in ms has elapsed and setImmediate(callback) designed to execute a script once the current poll phase completed.

        2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate? What will be the execution order?

            process.nextTick is not event loop while setImmediate is event loop. Process.nextTick is high priority to execute than
            setImmediate.
